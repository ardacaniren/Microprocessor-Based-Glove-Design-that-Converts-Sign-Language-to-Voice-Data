# Microprocessor-Based-Glove-Design-that-Converts-Sign-Language-to-Voice-Data
In the developed project, it is aimed that the person who has difficulties in communication can easily communicate with the person opposite, thanks to the output of the data from the sensors on the glove, via the microprocessor used, to the person's phone as voice and text. The aim of the project is to provide a practical use by adding frequently used expressions in daily life.
In this project;
Arduino Nano
5X Flex Sensors
GY-61 Accelerometer
HC-05 BT Module
Switch
Used. With this project, texts and sounds corresponding to the movements determined can be output from the mobile application. In addition, thanks to the switch, the audio outputs from the Arduino Bluetooth Text to Speech application can be taken in both Turkish and English. In addition, for energy saving, power is supplied to the arduino from the person's phone with a type c otg cable and the outputs are taken from the same phone in the same way.
