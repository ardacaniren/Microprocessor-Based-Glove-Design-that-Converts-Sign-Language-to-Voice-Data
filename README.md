# Microprocessor-Based-Glove-Design-that-Converts-Sign-Language-to-Voice-Data
Communication is one of the most important needs of all living things, especially humans. In this regard, Maslov developed a pyramid-shaped hierarchy of needs. When we look at Maslov's hierarchy of needs, physical and Right after our security needs, comes the need for belonging and love [1]. linguistic and auditory Disadvantaged people communicate through sign language to meet these needs. with these people In order to communicate, both parties must have knowledge of the subject of the sign. sign in the world The number of people who can understand and speak the language is limited.
